# Examples of First Contributions

There are many ways to make a helpful first contribution — not just code. Below are practical examples you can try in this repository or in most open‑source projects. Each item includes where to make changes and what a small, valuable contribution looks like.

## Quick Examples You Can Do Here

- Add yourself to the contributors list
  - File: `Contributors.md`
  - Action: Add your name and a link to your profile anywhere in the list (not top or bottom).

- Fix a typo or clarify documentation
  - Files: `README.md`, `docs/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects.md`, files under `docs/cli-tool-tutorials/`, `docs/gui-tool-tutorials/`, and `docs/additional-material/`
  - Action: Correct grammar/typos, improve unclear sentences, or add missing steps to make instructions easier to follow.

- Add or improve a translation of the README
  - Files: `docs/translations/README.<lang>.md`, `docs/translations/Translations.md`
  - Action: Create a new `README.<lang>.md` by adapting `README.md` to your language, then add an entry in `Translations.md` so others can find it.

- Contribute a GUI/CLI tutorial or translate one
  - Files: `docs/gui-tool-tutorials/` and `docs/cli-tool-tutorials/`
  - Action: Add a new tutorial for a tool you use (e.g., VS Code, GitHub Desktop) or translate an existing tutorial to your language, following the structure of similar files.

- Fix broken or outdated links
  - Files: Anywhere links appear (e.g., `README.md` and tutorials)
  - Action: Replace broken URLs, update redirects to the current canonical docs, and ensure link text clearly describes the destination.

- Improve accessibility in docs
  - Files: Primarily `README.md`
  - Action: Add meaningful `alt` text to images, ensure headings follow a logical hierarchy, and use descriptive link text.

- Enhance issue templates to guide good reports
  - Files: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue-template.md`
  - Action: Add sections for “Steps to Reproduce”, “Expected Behavior”, or “Screenshots” to help maintainers triage more effectively.

- Standardize formatting and style
  - Files: Any docs in `docs/`
  - Action: Align capitalization in headings, fix inconsistent list styles, and ensure code blocks use the right language tag for syntax highlighting.

## Helpful Commit Message Examples

- `docs: fix typo in README clone instructions`

## How to Find Opportunities

- Search for small improvements while reading docs; if something confused you, clarify it for the next person.
- Compare tutorials for different tools and languages; fill gaps where a tool or language is missing.
- Use the web app to discover beginner‑friendly projects: `https://firstcontributions.github.io/#project-list`.
- Practice more with code‑focused tasks: `https://github.com/roshanjossey/code-contributions`.

Start small, be specific, and make one clear improvement per pull request. That makes reviews fast and your contribution easy to merge.
