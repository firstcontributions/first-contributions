# GitHub Best Practices and Troubleshooting (Windows & VS Code)

This guide covers essential best practices, troubleshooting tips, and advanced features for using GitHub with VS Code on Windows. It complements the main tutorial and helps you avoid common pitfalls and work more efficiently.

---

## 1. Set Up SSH Keys for Secure Authentication
- Use SSH instead of HTTPS for easier authentication (no password prompts).
- Generate a key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
- Add the public key to your GitHub account ([instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh))
- Test with: `ssh -T git@github.com`

---

## 2. Configure Git User Information
- Set your name and email globally:
  - `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
  - `git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"`
- This ensures your commits are properly attributed.

---

## 3. Use .gitignore to Avoid Committing Unwanted Files
- Add a `.gitignore` file to your repo to exclude files like `node_modules`, `.env`, or OS-specific files.
- VS Code can generate a template: open Command Palette and search for `Add .gitignore`.

---

## 4. Stash Local Changes
- If you need to switch branches but have uncommitted changes:
  - `git stash` to save changes
  - `git stash pop` to re-apply them later

---

## 5. Use GitHub Issues and Projects
- Track bugs, feature requests, and tasks using GitHub Issues
- Organize work with GitHub Projects (Kanban boards)
- Link commits and pull requests to issues using `#issue-number` in commit or PR messages

---

## 6. Review Pull Requests Effectively
- Use the GitHub Pull Requests extension in VS Code to review, comment, and approve PRs
- Check for merge conflicts, code style, and clear commit messages

---

## 7. Revert or Amend Commits
- To undo the last commit (keep changes): `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
- To amend the last commit: `git commit --amend`
- To revert a pushed commit: `git revert <commit-hash>`

---

## 8. Fork and Upstream Workflow
- Always keep your fork up to date with the original repository:
  - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo.git`
  - `git fetch upstream`
  - `git merge upstream/main`

---

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **Authentication failed**: Use SSH or a personal access token (PAT)
- **Merge conflicts**: Use VS Code's merge editor to resolve
- **Detached HEAD**: Checkout a branch before making changes
- **Push rejected (non-fast-forward)**: Pull first, resolve conflicts, then push

---

## 10. Useful Git Aliases
- Speed up your workflow with aliases:
  - `git config --global alias.co checkout`
  - `git config --global alias.br branch`
  - `git config --global alias.ci commit`
  - `git config --global alias.st status`

---

## 11. Advanced: GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Automate tests, builds, and deployments with GitHub Actions
- Add a `.github/workflows/` YAML file to set up automation
- See [GitHub Actions Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

---

## 12. Security and Secrets
- Never commit sensitive data (passwords, API keys)
- Use environment variables and add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- Use GitHub's secret scanning and Dependabot alerts
