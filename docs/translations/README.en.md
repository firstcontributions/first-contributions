# First Contributions

It’s always difficult when you do something for the first time.  
Especially when collaborating with others — making mistakes isn’t fun.  
However, the idea of open-source software is based on collaboration.  
We want to teach new developers, in a simple way, how to make their first contribution to a project they don’t own.

Reading articles and watching tutorials can help,  
but is there anything better than trying it yourself — without worrying about breaking anything?  
This project aims to provide newcomers with guidance and simplify the process of making their first contribution.  
Remember: **the more relaxed you are, the better you learn.**  
If you want to make your first contribution, follow a few simple steps below.  
It’ll be fun — we promise!
