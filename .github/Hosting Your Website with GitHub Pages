💡 Tips for Enhancing Your Website
Themes: GitHub Pages offers built-in themes. To use one, create a _config.yml file in your repository with the following content:

theme: jekyll-theme-cayman
Replace jekyll-theme-cayman with your preferred theme.

Custom Domain: To use a custom domain, create a CNAME file in your repository containing your domain name (e.g., www.yourdomain.com).

Jekyll: GitHub Pages supports Jekyll, a static site generator. Learn more about Jekyll to enhance your website's functionality.
