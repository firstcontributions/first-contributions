Gophish: Open-Source Phishing Toolkit

[Gophish](https://getgophish.com) is an open-source phishing toolkit designed for businesses and penetration testers. It provides the ability to quickly and easily setup and execute phishing engagements and security awareness training.

### Install

Installation of Gophish is dead-simple - just download and extract the zip containing the [release for your system](https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/), and run the binary. Gophish has binary releases for Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

### Building From Source
**If you are building from source, please note that Gophish requires Go v1.10 or above!**

To build Gophish from source, simply run ```git clone https://github.com/gophish/gophish.git``` and ```cd``` into the project source directory. Then, run ```go build```. After this, you should have a binary called ```gophish``` in the current directory.

### Docker
You can also use Gophish via the official Docker container [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/gophish/gophish/).

### Setup
After running the Gophish binary, open an Internet browser to https://localhost:3333 and login with the default username and password listed in the log output.
e.g.
```
time="2020-07-29T01:24:08Z" level=info msg="Please login with the username admin and the password 4304d5255378177d"
```

Releases of Gophish prior to v0.10.1 have a default username of `admin` and password of `gophish`.
