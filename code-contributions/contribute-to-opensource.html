        <h2>How to Get Started with Open Source Contributions</h2>
        <h3>1. Choose the Right Project</h3>
        <p>
          Finding the right project is crucial. Look for projects that align
          with your interests, skill level, and goals. Here’s how to find them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Explore GitHub: Use GitHub’s Explore page or search for topics like
            "good-first-issue" or "help-wanted."
          </li>
          <li>
            Check Open Source Programs: Programs like Google Summer of Code or
            Hacktoberfest are great for beginners.
          </li>
          <li>
            Follow Your Tools: Contribute to libraries, frameworks, or tools you
            already use.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Understand the Project</h3>
        <p>Before contributing, take time to understand the project:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Read the Documentation: Start with the README file, contribution
            guidelines, and code of conduct.
          </li>
          <li>
            Explore the Codebase: Familiarize yourself with the project
            structure and coding style.
          </li>
