- Heuristic search
- Manhattan Distance
- Admissible and Informed Heuristics
- Hill Climbing
- Simulated Annealing
- A* search
- Adversarial Search
- Minimax

## **Advanced - Full stack web development**

- Computer networks (Don't need to go into heavy detail but an understanding is necessary)
- Backend web dev tools (This is for app logic and interfacing with databases etc).
    - Flask
    - Django
- Front end framework (This is for communicating with the backend)
    - Angular 6+
    - React/Redux (These are libraries not frameworks but most consider them a framework)
- With frontend you'll also need
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Javascript (also good to learn typescript which is used in angular. It makes writing Javascript nicer).
- Relational database (Pick one and learn it, they're all quite similar)
    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL
- Non-relational
    - MongoDB
    - Apache Cassandra (Wide-Column)
- Caching Systems
    - MemcacheD
    - Redis
- Cloud Computing (Knowledge of cloud computing is important nowadays)
    - AWS (Offers the most services and has a 1 year free tier)
    - Google Cloud
    - Azure

## **Other 'Must Knows'**

- Version Control
- Git (start using Github straight away, it's your portfolio!!!)
- SQL (Relational and Non-Relational Databases - Almost everywhere nowadays)
- Code Quality / Engineering Best Practices
- Basics of Cloud Computing - Pick a provider and start learning (AWS recommended - biggest selection of services)
- Scalable Systems Design - (https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
